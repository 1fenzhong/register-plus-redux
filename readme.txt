Enhances the user registration process with complete customization and additional administration options.

== Description ==

Register Plus Redux enables the user registration process to be customized in any way, big or small.  Is there another field you want users to fill out when registering?  Do you want to change the message your users receive after they register?  Do you want users to have to verify their email address is legitimate?  Do you want to queue up new users to be approved or denied by an administrator?  Register Plus Redux can do all that and more.

Enhancements to registration include:

* Customized registration page, including your own logo, disclaimer, license agreement, or privacy policy

* User-entered password (with password strength meter)

* Added profile fields

* Additional required fields for registration

* Invitation code system (with dashboard widget to track invites)

* User-defined fields

* Email verification of new users

* Administration verification of new users

* Customized new user message

* Customized administrator message

Also includes fixes for known Register Plus bugs. 

Register Plus Redux was forked from Register Plus, developed by skullbit, which was abandoned in 2008.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'register-plus-redux' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Manage settings from Register Plus Redux page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is Register Plus Redux related to Register Plus? =
Register Plus was abandoned by skullbit sometime after September, 2008 following the release of Register Plus 3.5.1.  As of September, 2009 skullbit's website was undergoing maintence.  Several bugs have been reported to the Register Plus plugin forum since that time, to resolve these bugs and continue development radiok forked the project.

= Didn't Register Plus have CAPTCHA? =
Register Plus offered two different CAPTCHA methods, a simple random CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA.  The simple one randomly created a 5-character sequence on a background image with two random lines drawn across the image, this CAPTCHA would be very easy for any OCR program to decipher as the characters were not modified in anyway and contrast was high.  reCAPTCHA is a great idea, but there is another plugin, [WP-reCAPTCHA](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/) endorsed by the reCAPTCHA developers that can be used to add reCAPTCHA to the registration page.  I also endorse the use of that plugin for that purpose.

== Worklog ==
TODO: Privacy Issue - When "Choose Password upon Registration" is active, the email that is sent to the user contains their password. It should be blocked out, omitted, or say "Password: [chosen upon registration]". as reported by iq9

TODO: More bugfixes per the following post
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/register-plus-is-adding-s-to-all-quote-marks-in-registration-email

FEATURE REQUEST: Registration widget, need to look into whether someone else took care of that, and if so how RegPlusRe interacts with that.
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/register-plus

CONSIDERATION: There could exist multiple unverified users with the same username, when a new user signs up, need to check that username isn't in que already

TODO: Migrate settings from Register Plus

TODO: Add localization back in

TODO: Add uninstall function

TODO: Make Redux compatible with Wordpress MU (wp-signup.php)

TODO: Fix datepicker

TODO: Nickname options

TODO: Would like to be able to upload the file a little bit nicer, almost like a form within a form

TODO: jQuery summarize user message status
